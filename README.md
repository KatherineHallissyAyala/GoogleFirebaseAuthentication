# GoogleFirebaseAuthentication
Small project to learn basic Google Firebase Authentication.  I created this project in the context of a full stack developer course.

# How to Use
In command line interface, browse to the folder where the files are stored.  Run "http-server."  You should see instructions on where you are locally hosting the file.  (My local host was http://127.0.0.1:8080/.)

The app displays username and password fields, plus Login and Google Login buttons.  Click on "Google Login" to log in using your Google ID.  You should see a modal window to confirm your Google ID, and then when you return to the app, you should see an update to the status text, which indicates the current user's email address.  Logging in also triggers the Log In buttons to disappear and a LOG OUT button to appear.
